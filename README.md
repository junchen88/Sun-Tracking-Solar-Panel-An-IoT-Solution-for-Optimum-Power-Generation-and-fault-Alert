# Sun Tracking Solar Panel: An IoT Solution for Optimum Power Generation and Fault Alert

This repository contains codes for the Sun Tracking Solar Panel: An IoT Solution for Optimum Power Generation and Fault Alert project.

The payload-formatters codes are used in TTN to decode the data from CayenneLPP format to ThingSpeak format.

The matlab-analysis-files codes are executed though ThingSpeak over the cloud.

The keyfiles contain credentials for connecting to TTN.
